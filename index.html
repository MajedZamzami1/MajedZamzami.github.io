      <p> Welcome to my about me page! My name is Majed Zamzami, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.
         I have a deep passion for computer science and aspire to establish a successful career in this field. Furthermore, I am fortunate enough to be a part of the KGSP (KAUST Gifted Student Program )
          which is one of the most prestigious scholarship programs in the world. This program has provided me with unique opportunities to gain knowledge, enhance my skills, and develop a global perspective.
           In order to showcase my abilities and potential to potential employers, clients, or partners, I have created this portfolio.
            The primary objective of this portfolio is to improve my professional image and highlight my achievements, experiences, and projects.
             By doing so, I hope to attract potential visitors to my website and encourage them to contact me regarding business proposals or opportunities.
              Thank you for taking the time to visit my page, and I hope you find it informative and engaging.</p>
